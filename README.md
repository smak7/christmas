christmas 

Hashtag Christmas provides a platform for exploring how cultures around the world celebrate Christmas. Working with the instagram api and the google map api, I created a map that populates images of people celebrating Christmas around the globe.

You can find my code for the project in this repsository. Please reach out if you have any questions or feedback! 

The link to the project is coming soon :)
